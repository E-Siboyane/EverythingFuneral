    <p>“As a South Africa, a working class, I had to burry loved ones before. It was a tough-time dealing with a loss of a loved one. 
    I could not come to terms with the reality I was facing, needless to say I was too drained to run around organise what I deemed   
    a simple/reasonable send-off. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To start with, I was not physically in the country, I was not familiar with anything around funerals, perhaps I knew just a bit – 
        but even then I could not have known where to source the things I needed at reasonable price (the flowers, well priced rental; chairs, 
        tent, cars etc., I had never spoken to the local church minister in a long time). During the event, most supplies ran-out and it became a 
        mission to stock-up. This made for a difficult burial experience - forget the high expense of a rushed job. “

        But who is ever ready for funerals? Most of us are caught by surprise, and even worse most of us learn latter what insurance policies, wills, 
        investments etc. the deceased leave behind. I never wanted to repeat this experience, and I got a wake-up call – one I would not “hang-up”, 
        hence Funeral Arrangements was born.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our personal experience is shared by many of you world over, as such most of us would welcome the services of Funeral Arrangements who were 
        created to put an end to this challenge.
